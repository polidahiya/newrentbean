        1. How and till when can I modify my order ?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        You can modify your order items up to one day before the scheduled
        delivery date by reaching us on customer helpline, or email. Please
        note, date and time of delivery may change due to modification of your
        order. On changing your order, rent and deposit will be automatically
        adjusted as per current rates at the time of placing your order. After
        successful confirmation, your monthly rental amount will be calculated
        based on the newly chosen items in your order.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        As a customer and party to the rental contract, your products cannot be
        shifted from the address mentioned in this delivery address to any other
        location without notifying Rentbean.in. In case of a change of address
        and assistance with relocation, please contact us two weeks prior to the
        relocation or raise a relocation request via the customer dashboard for
        further assistance.

      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        You can cancel an order up until one day before the agreed date of
        delivery without any extra cost. Once delivered, an existing order

        3. Can I return a few or all items of the order if Iâ€™m not happy with
        the products at the time of delivery ?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        Yes. While all our products pass a series of stringent quality checks,
        if you&#39;re not happy with the product&#39;s condition due to a defect or
        non-functionality, you may return the same at the time of delivery. If
        notified at the time of delivery, some exceptions can be considered in a
        valid case or circumstance. Please note, a return option will not be
        available at the time of delivery once our team exits your premises
        after successful confirmation of your order delivery. We also advise
        checking the product&#39;s specified dimensions before placing the order, as
        item rejection will not be considered eligible for return.

        4. Can I close my rental subscription prior to the committed tenure ?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        Yes, you can. In case of early termination of your order, you can
        request for closure for one or all your items by informing us 7 days
        before the selected preferred date. Early closure charge will be
        applicable since the products will be returned before the end of your
        chosen tenure. To raise a closure request,

        5. What are the early closure charges ?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        Since the products will be returned before the end of your chosen
        tenure, the early closure charge is calculated based on your selected
        tenure and based on the category of products. An Early Closure Charge is
        payable in case you decide to return the products before your current
        tenure is up. The charge payable is a multiple of your Monthly Rent,
        which is decided by the current tenure of your contract. Please check
        your customer dashboard or your contract for the exact amount payable at
        any time.

        6. How do I get my refundable deposit ?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[14px]  ">
        On approval of successful quality check of your rented products and
        clearance of any pending dues, a refund will be initiated towards your
        account. The same will be credited within 7-9 working days in the Bank
        account. Bank Account Details shared should be under the name of the
        Customer on whose name the order was placed. If you want to receive the
        refund amount to a different account, please reach our customer support
        for further assistance. In case of any damages to your rented products,
        Rentbean.in will inspect the products at our warehouse to determine a
        detailed breakdown of damage costs. The damage cost will then be
        deducted from your refundable amount.
