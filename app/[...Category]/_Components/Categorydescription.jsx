      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

      <h3>1. What is the best material for home decor furniture?</h3>
      <p>
        The best material depends on your style and the durability you&rsquo;re
        seeking. Solid wood furniture is an excellent choice for its durability,
        timeless appeal, and natural aesthetic. If you&rsquo;re looking for
        something light and modern, materials like metal or glass may also be
        great options.
      </p>

      <h3>2. How do I care for solid wood furniture?</h3>
      <p>
        Solid wood furniture is easy to maintain with regular dusting and
        occasional cleaning with a soft, damp cloth. To protect it from
        scratches and stains, use coasters and placemats. Applying wood polish
        once a year can help preserve its shine and prevent it from drying out.
